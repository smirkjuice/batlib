### batlib

---

batlib is a C++ library that is designed to (at least partially) replace the C++ Standard Library, while:

- Being as light as possible (resource-wise),
- Having no dependence on the C Standard Library,
- Having more features than the C++ Standard Library (this likely won't happen for a long time).
